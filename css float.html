    <h1> <span>The A.P.J.Abdul kalam</span> </h1>
    <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and
        statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram,
        Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering.</p>
    <p><img src="A._P._J._Abdul_Kalam.jpg" style="height: 250px; width: 250px; margin-left: 20px;"> A.P.J. Abdul Kalam,
        in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015,
        Shillong), Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in the development of India’s missile and
        nuclear weapons programs. He was president of India from 2002 to 2007.

        Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the
        Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research
        Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both
        designed and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of
        successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname “Missile Man.” Among those successes was Agni, India’s
        first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.

    <p class="a"><img src="apj.jpg" style="height: 150px;margin-right: 20px;">engineering, the application of science to the optimum conversion of the resources of nature to the uses of
        humankind. The field has been defined by the Engineers Council for Professional Development, in the United
        States, as the creative application of “scientific principles to design or develop structures, machines,
        apparatus, or manufacturing processes, or works utilizing them singly or in combination; or to construct or
        operate the same with full cognizance of their design; or to forecast their behaviour under specific operating
        conditions; all as respects an intended function, economics of operation and safety to life and property.” The
        term engineering is sometimes more loosely defined, especially in Great Britain, as the manufacture or assembly
        of engines, machine tools, and machine parts.</p>
